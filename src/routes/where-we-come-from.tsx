          Before any of this was a platform, it was a job. Two decades of running small
          businesses &mdash; and doing the online marketing for them, and for a few select
          clients who trusted us with theirs.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">
          Industry Army Marketing has been in the SEO and marketing business quietly for
          years. Not loud. Not funded. Just working. In that time we became something you
          only notice in hindsight: a collection of domains. Some grew into real strength.
          Some sat dormant &mdash; parked through years of hacks, rebuilds, and the ordinary
          ups and downs that come with actually living a life while you build one.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">
          Through all of it, the dream never changed: to build the best directory network in
          the world for small-business technology. A place where the operator who is great at
          what they do &mdash; and quiet about it &mdash; finally gets the tools to be found,
          trusted, and understood by the machines that now decide who gets seen.
        </p>

        <div className="my-12 border-l-2 border-[color:var(--acid)] pl-6">
          <p className="font-display text-2xl font-black uppercase leading-tight text-foreground sm:text-3xl">
            You can&rsquo;t fake twenty years.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-sm">
            The history is the point. It&rsquo;s the same reason the whole thing is built on
            verified provenance &mdash; the record you can&rsquo;t rewind and can&rsquo;t buy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          So here we are. Pre-money. No gateways open yet. Sitting still for a moment, looking
          around, and deciding &mdash; on purpose &mdash; to open slowly and to the right
          people first.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">
          We&rsquo;re not looking for everyone. We&rsquo;re looking for the businesses who
          genuinely love what they do and want to tell the world about it. The ones worth
          verifying. The ones worth building around.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-8 font-display text-xl font-black uppercase text-foreground">
          We&rsquo;re looking for you.
